# Nelson's Personal Backup Journal

Just wanted to provide a journal of my backup escapades with GTR since:

* It's good to show punctuality.
* It's good to show GTR is still working.
* There are rough edges with GTR/Google Takeout.
* Set a good example.

Top will be the latest.

## August 2023

Not sure why I am doing this again. Didn't realize I did this in July. Anyway, ran into some issues at 2AM where it seems the backups seemed to fail more to transfer than day. Added and edited some robustness to gtr-ext. It now seems to transload much, much more reliably :). 

## July 2023

Had issues with Google Takeout not putting out or failing. Eventually once succeeded.

Started backing up. Forgot I was on old extension in the old MacBook. Updated it. Cmd-Clicked down 3 at a time. Some failures. Followed up on them.

Got interrupted with tech support request from father in the middle of backup procedure; Super happy this was serverless and I could just resume backing up right after. ðŸ˜„

Was able to fully backup to Azure.
