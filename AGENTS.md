# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

Non-obvious, project-specific rules:

* `vitest` will block as it is a watching interactive command. Use `vitest run` instead.
* When testing with a browser, feel free to use https://gtr-2-dev-server-262382012399.us-central1.run.app/ as a test server to do end-to-end testing from. Feel free to read the README at https://github.com/nelsonjchen/gtr-2-dev-server for more information.
